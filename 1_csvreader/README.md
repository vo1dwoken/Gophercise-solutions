# Gophercise #1

### This is my solution to the [first](https://courses.calhoun.io/lessons/les_goph_01) exercise from [Gophercises](https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises)!

This exercise helped me to better understand and practice file opening/reading, reading standard input from the command line, CSV parsing, and most interestingly, introduced me to concurrency and how to use goroutines and channels.
